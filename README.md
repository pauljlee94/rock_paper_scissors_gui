# Rock Paper Scissors

## What is it
---
In this mini-project, I will be building a javascript based rock paper scissors game. The game will consist of 5 rounds where it tracks how many points the player or opponent(computer) has and will display the winner along with the scores and the end.

## What I'm learning
---
- Javascript fundamentals
    - Functions
    - Comparisons
    - Logitcal operators
    - Conditionals
    - *Learned basics of **while loop***

## Future Plans
---
- Need to refacotr
    - I think **playRound()** and **game()** can become a lot more concise than it is right now.
    - Maybe better variable names?
- UI
    - I want to add a visual element to the game.
